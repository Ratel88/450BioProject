<p><strong>View/Edit Gene Info (Control I)</strong><br>
  This option allows you to view and modify the gene annotations. Of course, you can view and edit this file outside MAGIC Tool, but this option provides you an opportunity to do so within MAGIC. Perhaps you will want to perform a search on the gene function. Viewing the list can allow you to select appropriate terms for searching. </p>
