<p><strong>Import Gene Info... (Control I)</strong><br>
  This allows you to compile more complete information about your ORFs. For example, we have created a text file that describes the chromosomal location, the three categories of gene ontology annotation, and synonym for all yeast genes. This permits you to search by each of these fields to help detect trends and meaningful information. </p>
