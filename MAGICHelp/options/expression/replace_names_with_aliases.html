<p><strong>Replace Names With Aliases</strong> <br />
  If you have imported gene info into your active expression file, it likely contains aliases, or common names, for the genes. You can see these aliases by choosing View/Edit Gene Info. For example, YBR167C&rsquo;s alias is POP7. The "Replace Names With Aliases" option allows you to replace the gene names as defined in the gene list with their alias in the info file, creating a new expression file in the process. The old gene name will be the alias in the new expression file. If the alias appears more than once, each appearance will be appended with "_repX" where X is a number from 1 to the number of times that the alias occurs. If a gene does not have an alias, its name will not change.</p>
