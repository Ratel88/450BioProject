<p><strong>Average Replicates</strong><br>
  MAGIC Tool treats every spot as a unique feature and does not average for replicate genes automatically. This preserves all your original ratio data. If a set of feature names are identical in the gene list, MAGIC Tool will give each replicate a unique name by appending _rep1, _rep2, etc.&nbsp; After you have created expression files, you may choose to average replicate spots as defined by ORF name. When you average replicates, all features with identical names (disregarding _rep#) then the data will be averaged. </p>
