The name you give to the project is the name of the folder, and the folder is automatically created by MAGIC Tool.&nbsp; Each project name should be unique and descriptive. Within the folder created by MAGIC Tool will be a file that ends with the suffix ".gprj". All subsequent steps and files will be stored automatically in this project folder, until you start another new project.&nbsp; The .gprj file is a text file that is essentially a table of contents of your project.</p>
