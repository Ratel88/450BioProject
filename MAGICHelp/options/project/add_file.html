<p><strong>Add File....</strong><br>
  Allows you to add files (e.g. tiff files, gene lists, info files, existing expression files) from other projects to your current project. You will be directed to a window from which you can click your way through the hard drive in search of the files you want to add. Holding down Shift and clicking allows you to select a consecutive range of files. (On Windows, you can hold down the control key and click on multiple files to select them.)</p>
