  Once you have create a cluster or two, you can display them. First, choose the cluster
  file you want to display. Each type of cluster
  has its own display options.</p>
<table width="60%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%"><em>Hierarchical Cluster Display</em></td>
    <td width="67%"><img src="../../images/image132.png" alt="hierarchical display options" width="397" height="53" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> You have three options for display, each of
which has its own options.<br>
<img src="../../images/image136.png" alt="tree" width="183" height="197" align="right" > <u><img src="../../images/image134.png" alt="plot" width="277" height="211" align="left" >Metric Tree</u> is unique to hierarchical clustering. It produces a dendrogram with nodes plotted at indicated thresholds. The smaller the threshold number, the higher the correlation coefficient. You can click on a branch point 
and highlight all the genes within 
this cluster as shown. If you mouse 
over the branch point, you can see 
the exact threshold which is 1 minus 
the correlation coefficient (~0.96). 
You can plot this cluster and as you
would image with this high a 
correlation coefficient, the normalized data plot as a very tight group. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><img src="../../images/image139.jpg" alt="exploding tree" width="180" height="169" align="right" >Exploding Tree</u> is an efficient way to show clusters and gradually expand the contents of each node. In this example, there is one gene and then all other genes 
  are within node number 2. As you click on the nodes, they expand 
  and if you click a second time, they collapse. You can explode the
  node completely by highlighting the number and clicking on the 
  explode button, or explode it one at a time by clicking on the node
  directly. You can also plot any cluster within a node by clicking on the "Plot Node As Group" button.</p>
<p><br>
  <u>Tree/Table</u> is a way to combine the Table view and the dendrogram.&nbsp; The dendrogram is on the far left and the colored table (the majority of the window) is displayed on the right (view not shown). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="46%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="32%"><em>QT Cluster Display</em></td>
    <td width="68%"><img src="../../images/image141.jpg" alt="qt cluster" width="276" height="39" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> QT cluster also allows Exploding tree and Tree/Table, but it has replaced the metric tree with <u>List</u>. List allows you to see the name of the root gene for each cluster. If you click on the root gene, then all the genes within this cluster are displayed. You can plot this cluster as shown here.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/image144.gif" alt="plot" width="293" height="151" ></p>
<table width="74%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%"><em>Supervised (QT)  Cluster Display</em></td>
    <td width="67%"><img src="../../images/image146.jpg" alt="supervised" width="245" height="56" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> Supervised Cluster hast the same display options
as regular QT Cluster. However, when you are
choosing your display, you should note the 
box that indicates what threshold was used and which
gene was used as the root. In this case, ERD2, the
KDEL receptor exon 1 was used as the root for this
cluster with a correlation coefficient of 0.95 (plot not shown).</p>
<table width="60%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%"><em>K-Means Cluster Display </em></td>
    <td width="67%"><img src="../../images/image147.png" alt="k-means" width="372" height="56" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>  The three displays possible for K-means cluster display
are described above. </p>
