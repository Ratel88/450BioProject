<p><strong>(11) Filter data</strong></p>
<p>You should filter your data to remove uninteresting genes before proceeding to the next steps. For example, you might keep only those genes whose expression pattern has a sufficiently large standard deviation across the columns (in other words, whose expression is not constant). Or you might remove genes with unreliable ratios (including those involving a division by 0). It is important that your expression file be as small as possible, without losing important information, before beginning the clustering process.You can filter by saving the results of queries in the &quot;Exploring&quot; window as an expression file. </p>
