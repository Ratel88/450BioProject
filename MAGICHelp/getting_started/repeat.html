<p><strong>(7) Repeat steps 1-6 for all experimental conditions</strong></p>
<p>If you have multiple time points or experimental conditions in your study, you should repeat steps 1-6 for each condition before continuing to the data manipulations of step 8.&nbsp; Once you have all data in one file, continue with the remaining steps.&nbsp; If you have only one condition, there will only be one column of data in your file, and you can do steps 8-11.</p>
