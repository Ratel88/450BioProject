  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section was intended as a way to get you launched into the MAGIC Tool way of working with DNA microarrays. MAGIC allows you to compare the consequences of different choices for quantifying, comparing and clustering the same raw dataset. This capacity to compare methods is a powerful way to understand better the assumptions and implications inherent in data analysis as published each week. MAGIC allows you to explore data and data analysis during the early days of DNA microarrays when the research community has not settled upon standards for comparing results. MAGIC was designed to empower the user and make DNA microarrays more approachable for a wider audience. In the following section, every option available in MAGIC Tool will be spelled out so you can utilize the full potential of MAGIC Tool. </p>
