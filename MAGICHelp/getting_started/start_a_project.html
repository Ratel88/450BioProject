<p><strong>(1) Start a Project</strong><br>
  Under the Project menu, create a new Project. You can save this project in a convenient location on your hard drive. We recommend that you NOT use the MAGIC Tool software folder, since you may want to open this project with a newer version of MAGIC Tool in the future. Project files are automatically given a name that ends with the suffix &quot;.gprj&quot; and stored in a folder by the same name, automatically created by MAGIC Tool.</p>
