<p align="center"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></p>
<p align="left"><br>
    <strong>Addressing</strong> is the short process of telling MAGIC Tool the layout of the spots and grids in the tiff file as viewed within MAGIC. </p>
<p><strong>Chip</strong> is a synonym for a microarray. </p>
<p><strong>Feature</strong> is a synonym for a single spot on a microarray. </p>
<p><strong>Flag</strong> is a verb that means you mark a particular spot to indicate its data are not reliable. This may be due to high background in the area, a dust bunny sitting on the spot, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Grid</strong> is a compact arrangement of spots with even spacing.</p>
<p><strong>Gridding</strong> is the process that MAGIC uses to find the spots on your tiff files</p>
<p><strong>Metagrid</strong> is a higher order level of organization. A set of grids are organized into groups called metagrids. For a more complete description, see this web page &lt;<a href="http://www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/GCAT/Griding.html">www.bio.davidson.edu/projects/GCAT/Griding.html</a>&gt;. </p>
<p><strong>Segmentation</strong> is the process of finding the signal and distinguishing it from the background. There are three methods in MAGIC. Fixed circle is the fastest, and recommended for most purposes.&nbsp; Adaptive circle and seeded region growing are also provided.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong> files (e.g. file_name.tif) are the raw image data that are produced when a DNA microarray is scanned. One tiff file is produced for each color on each chip. </p>
