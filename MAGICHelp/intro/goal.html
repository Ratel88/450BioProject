<p><strong>The Goal of MAGIC Tool</strong><br>
  The purpose of MAGIC Tool is to allow the user to begin with DNA microarray tiff files and end with biologically meaningful information. Comparative hybridization data (glass chips) and Affymetrix data are compatible with MAGIC Tool. You can start with tiff files or expression files (spreadsheet of ratios or absolute expression levels). <br>
  MAGIC Tool was created with the novice in mind but it is not a "dumbed down" program. In fact, MAGIC Tool is designed to illuminate the algorithms being used rather than be a black box that produces results with little input from the user. MAGIC Tool allows the user to change parameters for clustering, data quantification etc. This User's Guide will teach you how to use the software but leaves the theoretical explanations to the Instructor's Guide. <br>
